    What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs

What is Responsive Web Design?

Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to
 look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.

Bootstrap Versions
Bootstrap 5 (released 2021) is the newest version of Bootstrap (released 2013); with new 
components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness.

Bootstrap 5 supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.
 However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.

The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has 
switched to vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery.

Note: Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes 
and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safe to continue to use them. However,
 new features will NOT be added to them.

Why Use Bootstrap?
Advantages of Bootstrap:

Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, 
Edge, Safari, and Opera). Note that if you need support for IE11 and down, you must use 
either BS4 or BS3.

Where to Get Bootstrap 5?
There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 5 on your own web site.

You can:

Include Bootstrap 5 from a CDN
Download Bootstrap 5 from getbootstrap.com

Bootstrap 5 CDN
If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, you can include it from a
 CDN (Content Delivery Network).

jsDelivr provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript:


One advantage of using the Bootstrap 5 CDN:
Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 5 from jsDelivr when visiting another site.
 As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster
  loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it,
   it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.


JavaScript?
Bootstrap 5 uses JavaScript for different components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc).
 However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.

Downloading Bootstrap 5
If you want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, go to https://getbootstrap.com/, 
and follow the instructions there.
